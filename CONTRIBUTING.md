# Contributing to DDClient Extended

We want to make contributing to this project as approachable and transparent as
possible, whether it is:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the project
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

&nbsp;

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

&nbsp;

## Any contributions you make will be under the GNU General Public License v3.0

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github [issues](https://github.com/smith8ca/ddclient-extended/issues)

I use GitHub Issues to triage bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/smith8ca/ddclient-extended/issues/new/choose).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample configurations

DDClient Extended includes a a few different configuration options. Please include as much information (configurations, deployment method, Docker & API versions, etc) as you can when reporting an issue.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Specific steps to reproduce
  - Give example configurations if you can
- What the expected behavior would have been
- What the actual behavior is
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
